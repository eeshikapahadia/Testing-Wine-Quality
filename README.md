# Testing-Wine-Quality

This project uses MLflow to :
* Train a linear regression model
* Package the code that trains the model in a reusable and reproducible model format
* Deploy the model into a simple HTTP server that will enable you to score predictions

We use a dataset to predict the quality of wine based on quantitative features like the wine’s “fixed acidity”, “pH”, “residual sugar”, and so on.
